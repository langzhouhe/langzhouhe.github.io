# About Me

Welcome to my page! I'm Langzhou He, a first-year Ph.D. student in [Big Data and Social Computing (BDSC) Lab](https://bdsc-uic.github.io/index.html) at the [University of Illinois Chicago](https://www.uic.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [Philip S. Yu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~psyu/). I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science with honors from Southwest University, where I worked closely with Prof. [Li Tao](http://cis.swu.edu.cn/info/1014/1208.htm) and Prof. [Chao Gao](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/info/1015/1362.htm).

My research interests primarily lie in machine learning and data mining, with a specific focus on graph machine learning, foundation models, and their practical applications. I am currently committed to advancing generative AI for relational data, particularly in domains such as finance and scientific research.
